# Agent instructions for airc

ccbridge drives an unmodified interactive coding agent in a pseudo-terminal: text in over a WebSocket, plain text out, no display artifacts. Only the harness templates are harness-specific; the PTY, screen, session, server and tools are not.

## Invariants

- Never pass a flag that makes a harness non-interactive or key-based: `-p`, `--print`, `--bare`, `--api-key`, `--settings`, `--safe-mode`, `--restricted`. The session must authenticate exactly as a human's does. `ccbridge capture` refuses them. Server launch args come only from a template's `resume`, `continue`, `fork` and `fork_continue` forms, never from client input.
- Output is read from the harness's own transcript or store, never by scraping the screen. The screen is used for ready and busy markers, freebuff notice lines, and the `pane_tail` field of `GET /sessions`.
- A harness launches with its `env_strip` variables removed from the child environment, so a harness started inside another session runs as a normal top-level session.
- Max-plan / OAuth is never bypassed: no injected API key, base URL or auth token.
- No comments in source: intent lives in names, durable facts live here.

## Harnesses

A harness is a template, `templates/<name>.json`. Templates are read at run time from the search path: `--templates DIR`, `$CCBRIDGE_TEMPLATES`, `<resource root>/templates`, `./templates`. The built-in transcript kinds are `claude-jsonl`, `codex-jsonl`, `freebuff-json` and `opencode-sqlite`.

| fact | claude | codex | freebuff | opencode |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ready markers (any) | `❯`, `esc to interrupt`, `Claude Code` | `Ask Codex to do anything`, `to get started, describe a task`, `esc to interrupt` | `Enter a coding task`, `for history · ? for help`, `Starting your model session` | `Ask anything`, `esc interrupt` |
| busy marker | `esc to interrupt` | `esc to interrupt` | `Starting your model session` | `esc interrupt` |
| transcript | `~/.claude/projects/<slug(cwd)>/*.jsonl` | `$CODEX_HOME/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl` plus `state_*.sqlite` table `threads` | `$FREEBUFF_HOME` or `~/.config/manicode`, then `projects/<basename(cwd)>/chats/<id>/chat-messages.json` | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` (SQLite, opened read-only): tables `session`, `message`, `part` |
| record shape | `assistant`/`user` records; `message.content` blocks; text stitched by `apiBlockIndex` within `message.id`, accumulated across polls and emitted as deltas of the stitched text | `response_item` payloads: `message` (assistant and user text), `reasoning` (summary), `function_call`, `function_call_output`; `session_meta.payload.cwd` selects the session | JSON array of `{variant: user or ai, blocks: [{type, content, textType?}], isComplete?, userError?}` |
| turn end | `system` record with `subtype: turn_duration` | `event_msg` with `payload.type: task_complete` | `isComplete`; a `userError` is sent as a result first; a notice line on the screen (`Not enough hours`, `Choose another model`, `not available on this connection`) also ends the turn | assistant message with `time.completed` and `finish` other than `tool-calls`; its `error` is sent as a result first |
| resume | `--resume <id>` | `resume <id>` | `--continue <id>` | `--session <id>` |
| continue | `--continue` | `resume --last` | `--continue` | `--continue` |
| fork | `--resume <id> --fork-session`, `--continue --fork-session` | `fork <id>`, `fork --last` | none | `--session <id> --fork`, `--continue --fork` |
| selector | absolute `.jsonl` path, session UUID, or name | session UUID or name | chat directory id | session id `ses_…` |

Binding: claude and codex bind an exact session id or path. An unknown non-UUID name binds the newest store for the cwd at its end. A UUID not found in the cwd is looked up across the whole store, and if that also fails the attach is refused; there is no silent fallback. Freebuff accepts chat ids only.

Channel: records whose timestamp is more than 3 s before the hub started are skipped. A file is bound only if its mtime is within 3 s of the start. A resumed hub reads its file from the end. Results are cut to 4000 code points.

## Protocol

`GET /ws` upgrades to WebSocket. Query parameters:

- `session`: named hub; reconnect with the same name to keep talking. Default `default`.
- `harness`: template name, fixed when the hub is created. Default: the template with `"default": true`.
- `cwd`: working directory, new hub only. Default `CCBRIDGE_CWD`, else `<process cwd>/.ccbridge/scratch`.
- `mode`: `plain` (default) or `tagged`, per client.
- `kinds`: comma list, default `text,tool`. Unknown names are ignored.
- `resume=<id>`: new hub only; launches the harness's resume form.
- `continue=1`: new hub only; continue form. `resume` and `continue` are exclusive.
- `fork=1`: with `resume` or `continue`, uses the fork form.

Frames:

- Client to server: a text frame is a prompt. Blank frames are ignored.
- Server to client, `plain`: text as it is produced; an empty frame ends the turn.
- Server to client, `tagged`: `t:` text, `k:` thinking, `u:` tool, `r:` result, `y:` you, `e:` turn end.
- A client attaching mid-turn receives only events produced after it attaches. Nothing is replayed.
- When the agent process exits, every client receives an empty frame.

HTTP:

- `GET /` serves the browser client.
- `GET /sessions` lists hubs with `clients`, `alive`, `harness`, `cwd`, `busy`, `launch_args` and `pane_tail` (the last 12 non-blank screen lines).
- `DELETE /sessions/{name}` stops a hub and its agent process.

Lifecycle:

- A hub whose agent is not alive is replaced on the next attach. An alive hub asked for different launch args is refused; stop it first.
- A hub is reaped only when it has no clients, its pane shows no busy marker, and it has had no activity for `CCBRIDGE_IDLE_REAP` seconds (`--idle-reap`, default 1800). Activity is a prompt, a client attach or detach, a transcript event, a change of the pane, or a pane that is busy; the hub's pump samples the pane every 150 ms. A busy hub is never reaped, however long no client is attached, and its idle period starts when the busy marker leaves. The reaper runs once per idle period, clamped to between 1 s and 60 s.
- Limits: 16 MiB per inbound frame; WebSocket idle timeout 60 s with keep-alive pings.

## Run

Builds and tests run in GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Locally, the same steps are:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
./build/ccbridge serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
./build/ccbridge client --harness codex "hi"
./build/ccbridge send --harness freebuff --cwd DIR "hi"
./build/ccbridge capture --harness freebuff --seq '["hi"]' --out runs/fb.raw --dump-markers
./build/ccbridge analyze runs/fb.raw --view text --tail 40
./build/ccbridge templates --check
cmake --build build --target claude_channel_test && ./build/claude_channel_test
CCBRIDGE_BIN=build/ccbridge bash tests/e2e.sh
```

Adding an agent that uses an existing transcript kind needs only a new `templates/<name>.json` (fields in `templates/README.md`); no rebuild. A new transcript format needs a kind in `src/harness/kinds/`, registered in `src/harness/transcript.cpp`.

## gm state

The append-only PRD log `.gm/prd-log.jsonl`, its row shards `.gm/prd-log.d/` and `.gm/next-step.md` are authored project state and are not ignored. PRD row folders `.gm/prd/` and `.gm/unknowns/`, spools, caches, databases, counters, locks, dream-rsi scratch, browser captures, `.agentplug/`, `.agentplug-kv/` and core dumps are transient and ignored. `.env` and `.env.local` stay out of the repo.
